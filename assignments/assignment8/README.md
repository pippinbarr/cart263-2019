# Assignment 8: Project 3 Prototype

__Grade__: 1.25% of final grade (pass/fail)  
__Deadline__: 11:59PM on the day of class on week of 1 April 2019 ( ha ha ha ).

---

## Brief

Create a small __prototype__ version of some __specific aspect__ of Project 3. The only requirements are:

- It must run
- It must be interactive
- It must represent a non-trivial amount of work (a week's worth)
- It must be submitted as separate Assignment 8 version of the code (don't just point to Project 3 in your repository)

If you have already created a prototype like this (which would have been a good idea), then feel free to just submit that (again, remember to create a separate version from your actual Project 3 code).

__NOTE:__ This brief is the bare minimum of additions in order to pass, please always use these assignments as a playground to try out more than the bare minimum!
